# PhoneBook

### About

Fullstack web application for managing phone contacts. It allows users to create accounts and perform operations on contacts stored in an address book.

### Project Goal

The project was refactored from JavaScript to TypeScript to gain valuable experience in code improvement, refactoring, and to continue learning TypeScript. This refactoring not only enhanced code maintainability and type safety but also provided an opportunity to integrate a backend into the existing codebase. Additionally, the project aimed to explore deployment on AWS and become familiar with the Linux environment, specifically Ubuntu. This experience was crucial for understanding end-to-end application management and deployment practices.
